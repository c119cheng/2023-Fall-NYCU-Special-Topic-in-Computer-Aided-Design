# Programming Assignments of Special Topics in Computer Aided Design

## HW1 : Logic optimization
Implement a two level logic optimizer based on Quine-McCluskey method. First generate all prime implicants for the given function. Second, generate a sum of products expression of this function with minimum number of prime implicant.
